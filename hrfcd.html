            <h1 class="para">On November 3rd, we visited Baku Secondary School No. 270 to host the Hour of Code.<br> There were 20 students, all of whom were seventh graders. Firstly, we showed students a presentation,<br> and Rafig Isayev talked about ADA University. During this event, we were teaching students<br> the basics of computer science. Sadig Hasanli explained the basics of that course<br> so it would be easier for students to start solving these tasks by themselves.<br> After an explanation, students solved these problems in code.org,<br> and Novruz Mirishli and Jamal Izabakarov helped them solve them correctly.</h1>
